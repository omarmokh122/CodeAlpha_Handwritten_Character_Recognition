# CodeAlpha_Handwritten_Character_Recognition
Handwritten Character Recognition using TensorFlow and Keras. This project builds a model with CNN and Bidirectional LSTM layers, trained on a Kaggle dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. A Gradio interface allows real-time predictions from handwritten images.
